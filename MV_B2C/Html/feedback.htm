<i>"The overall ambience of the trip was outstanding, during visits to six cities we visited the Three Gorges Dam, the Terracotta Army, the Forbidden City, and the Great Wall, among a host of lesser known historical and cultural sites. The tour was run flawlessly with superb accommodations, food, transportation and local guides.....it was a splendid job in promoting contact between The University of Memphis and Chinese universities."<br><br>
