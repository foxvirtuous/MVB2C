                                        <em>As you know, I primarily asked you to reserve hotel rooms (at places we chose) and
                                            help us with the airport transfers, as well as a day trip to Souchou. The guides
                                            were excellent, spoke English well, and helped us have a most enjoyable time. The
                                            guide in Shanghai also helped my daughter make a purchase of equipment she needed
                                            for a computer, and we could never have managed this without her help and skill
                                            in communicating and knowing where to make this kind of purchase.<br>

                                            to do so.<br>

                                            Thank you, too, for responding in a timely fashion to my anxiety about traveling
                                            without vouchers. I observed a group in South America two years ago who had not
                                            received vouchers from their travel agent, and they had many difficulties. Asia,
                                            it seems, or at least United Vacations Asia (operated by Majestic Vacations) , is
                                            much more up-to-date. I appreciate your skill and professional expertise.</em><br>

                                        efficient and left no stone unturned to make our trip the best possible. They made
                                        sure that the food ordered met our dietery restrictions at every meal. The accompanying
                                        drivers also deserve full praise. Majestic should be very proud of the working ethics
                                        of its employees.<br>

                                        We loved China. People were very friendly and welcoming everywhere. The places we
                                        went to were spectacular and it was mind blowing to be introduced to China's history
                                        and her present day achievements.<br>

                                        The tour has been planned in an excellent manner. All aspects of sightseeing including
                                        cultural shows and local cuisine have been factored in. On our own we would never
                                        have been able to have such an excellent tour plan. Thank you and we will surely
